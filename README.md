## My process

### Built with

- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- Bitly

### What I learned

I practiced my layout skills and learned new concepts to use the Bitly api.

### Continued development

Bitly is a very popular and useful tool, which I had never explored until the time I developed this project, so for now I only know the basics of Bitly, I plan to take another look at the documentation to explore more features.

### Useful resources

- [Bitly Developer](https://dev.bitly.com/) - Bitly's documentation explains how to manage your links and implement its API in your projects, from authentication, rate limits, managing analytics, etc.

## Installation

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd url-shortening
yarn
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file and enter the credentials provided by Bitly.
Use the `.env.local.example` as an example.

### Run the project

```bash
yarn start
```
